The goal given was to create a hangman game using the console
to display the prompts, hangman, and guesses. I went a step
further and created an interface using JQuery. Since I don't
like the idea of hanging anyone, I went with a Street Fighter
themed game. This was my 1st attempt just using JQuery.

You can play the game here: http://boring-join.surge.sh/
